    pip install BraineryWiz

Windows users use above command in command prompt (cmd) and Anaconda users use it in Anaconda Prompt. After instalation import the BraineryWiz library into your code as shown in the following:

    import BraineryWiz as bz
	
.. note::

   Currently BraineryWiz does not work on Linux. Sorry fo that. Soon we will solve the problem and make it accessible in the mentioned system.

.. note::

   BraineryWiz now has been compiled for multiple versions of Python. Currently **Python version 3.12.3** works for lates released version and **Python version 3.11.5** and **Python version 3.10.4** works but for older version of BraineryWiz. **If you are not using Anaconda**, you have to wait until anaconda supports Python version 3.12. Now you can install BraineryWiz and it works but it is not the lates version of BraineryWiz.
