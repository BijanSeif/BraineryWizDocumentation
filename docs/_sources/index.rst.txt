   **BraineryWiz** is mainly a Python package for plotting **OpenSees (A Finite Element analyze Software) models**. There is also a TCL version that can be used to show the OpenSees models created using TCL programming language. Beside them FEMWiz is a Python package that currently exist inside the Python version of BraineryWiz to plot any Finite Element models.
